                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am a PhD Scholar at Dublin City University specializing in Finance and Family Business research. My research focuses on financial decision-making in family firms, particularly examining how varying levels of family ownership influence capital structure decisions. I explore the critical role of institutional quality in shaping financing choices between debt and equity options.</p>
                
                <p>My work also investigates how family firms contribute to democratic processes and examines the distinctive behavioral patterns of family businesses in the Global South, where economic and institutional contexts create unique challenges and opportunities.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond academia, I maintain interests in chess, cricket, geopolitics, and cinema, which provide diverse perspectives that enrich my analytical approach to business and finance research.</p>

                    <p class="post-date">August 2025</p>
                    <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of my research is how family firms in the Global South operate under fundamentally different institutional constraints compared to their Western counterparts. While Western literature often views family ownership as a potential agency problem, my preliminary findings suggest that in emerging markets, family control may actually serve as a substitute for weak institutional frameworks...</p>

                    <p class="post-date">July 2025</p>
                    <p>An intriguing question that emerged during my literature review: How do family businesses contribute to democratic stability? Initial evidence suggests that family firms, with their long-term orientation and community embeddedness, may serve as important stabilizing forces in developing democracies...</p>

                    <p>Cricket remains the ultimate strategic sport - a perfect blend of individual brilliance and team dynamics. The recent evolution of T20 formats has revolutionized batting approaches, but Test cricket still represents the purest form of the game.

                    <p>Chess taught me pattern recognition and strategic thinking that directly applies to my research methodology. The concept of sacrificing short-term gains for long-term positional advantage resonates strongly with family firm strategies. Magnus Carlsen's intuitive style versus Stockfish's computational precision reflects the eternal debate between human judgment and algorithmic decision-making in finance...</p>

Whether it's the narrative structure of Christopher Nolan's films or the character development in Indian parallel cinema, movies have shaped how I approach academic writing.
