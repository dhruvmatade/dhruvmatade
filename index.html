                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am a PhD Scholar at Dublin City University specializing in Finance and Family Business research. My research focuses on financial decision-making in family firms, particularly examining how varying levels of family ownership influence capital structure decisions. I explore the critical role of institutional quality in shaping financing choices between debt and equity options.</p>
                
                <p>My work also investigates how family firms contribute to democratic processes and examines the distinctive behavioral patterns of family businesses in the Global South, where economic and institutional contexts create unique challenges and opportunities.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond academia, I maintain interests in chess, cricket, geopolitics, and cinema, which provide diverse perspectives that enrich my analytical approach to business and finance research.</p>

                    <p class="post-date">August 2025</p>
                    <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of my research is how family firms in the Global South operate under fundamentally different institutional constraints compared to their Western counterparts. While Western literature often views family ownership as a potential agency problem, my preliminary findings suggest that in emerging markets, family control may actually serve as a substitute for weak institutional frameworks...</p>

                    <p>An intriguing question that emerged during my literature review: How do family businesses contribute to democratic stability? Initial evidence suggests that family firms, with their long-term orientation and community embeddedness, may serve as important stabilizing forces in developing democracies...</p>

                    <h3>üèè Cricket</h3>
                    <p>Cricket remains, for me, the most complete strategic sport and my first love. T20 has brought colour to evenings and transformed the way batting is approached, yet the long form holds my deepest loyalty. A Test match in England, under a heavy sky with the ball moving late through the air, offers a theatre unmatched in sport. With a cup of tea or a pint in hand, I watch the game unfold in deliberate rhythms. Every ball poses a question, every over shapes a paragraph, and every session builds a chapter. Over five days, patience and flair share equal importance, and the story becomes richer for the time it takes to tell.</p>

                    <h3>‚ôüÔ∏è Chess</h3>
                    <p>Then there is chess, a complete universe contained within sixty-four squares. Mikhail Tal's fearless combinations, Bobby Fischer's effortless control, and the enduring dominance of Kasparov and Karpov each reveal distinct paths to mastery. Viswanathan Anand's calm authority, Kramnik's resilient defence, and Magnus Carlsen's adaptable brilliance demonstrate the balance between precision and creativity. Today, Gukesh, Praggnanandhaa, and Alireza Firouzja bring a fresh intensity, blending deep calculation with the courage to take risks.</p>

                    <h3>üé¨ Cinema</h3>
                    <p>Film is storytelling at its finest, and every good research paper tells a story. Whether it's the narrative structure of Christopher Nolan's films or the character development in Indian parallel cinema, movies have shaped how I approach academic writing. The way filmmakers handle unreliable narrators offers insights into how we might interpret conflicting data in family business research...</p>

                    <p>Understanding global power dynamics is crucial for financial research, especially when studying emerging markets. The rise of the Global South isn't just an economic phenomenon - it's reshaping how we understand corporate governance, institutional quality, and family business models. Current geopolitical shifts are creating new opportunities to test existing financial theories...</p>
